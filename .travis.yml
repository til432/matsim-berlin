stages:
  - package
  - test

# this is the script run in the "test" stage:
# 'failsafe:verify' triggers travis failures for errors/failures of integration tests. 
script: mvn -Dtest=${TEST} test --batch-mode -Dmaven.test.redirectTestOutputToFile -Dmatsim.preferLocalDtds=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip

# (would be nice to run this also in parallel with the others.  But it
# is either the matrix thing and then exactly the same command for
# each module.  Or hand-written entries (see .travis.yml.nomatrix),
# which in particular has the disadvantage that one cannot see the
# failing module at the travis toplevel.)
